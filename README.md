# Simon Game
This website is an application that is modeled off the game Simon. You can press any key to start and it will shows you a set of tiles that you have to click on. As you go from level to level the patterns get more and more complicated and at some point you're going to screw up. Finally, it's going to tell you that you've got it wrong.

There is no winning, play is for highest level count.
